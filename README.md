# 🌐AWS Power Calculator: From Zero to Web App 🚀
Ever wondered how to build a web application on AWS from the ground up? Look no further! This project takes you on a guided tour, using 5 core AWS services to create a simple yet powerful web app that calculates the power of a number.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases the process of creating a fully functional web application on AWS, leveraging various AWS services for a scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure. Whether you're new to AWS or looking to deepen your cloud architecture skills, this guide will provide a clear, step-by-step approach to building a robust application.

### Key Features
**Scalable Architecture:** The application is designed to handle varying loads, ensuring smooth performance as user traffic grows.
**Secure & Reliable: **Implementing AWS best practices, the application ensures data security and reliability across all layers.
**Fully Managed Services**: Leveraging AWS managed services to minimize operational overhead and focus on innovation.

### 💡 Project Highlights:
**No AWS experience needed:** We start from scratch, explaining each step and AWS service clearly.
**Hands-on learning:** You'll actively build the app, gaining practical AWS skills.
**Real-world architecture:** The project uses a common web app pattern, valuable for future projects.
**Clean code & best practices:** Learn to write maintainable code and use AWS efficiently.

### 🚀 Tech Stack:
**AWS Amplify**: Effortless web hosting and deployment.
**AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute for our calculations.
**Python:** The language of choice for our Lambda function.
**AWS DynamoDB:** A NoSQL database to store calculation results (optional).
**AWS API Gateway:** Securely connect our frontend and backend.
### 🛠️ How It Works:
**Frontend:**
- A user-friendly web page built with Amplify.
- Users input a base number and power.

**Backend:**
- API Gateway receives the input and triggers a Lambda function.
- The Lambda function, written in Python, performs the calculation.
- The result is returned to the frontend and displayed.
- Optionally, the result is also stored in DynamoDB for future reference.


### 🎯 Learning Outcomes:
1. Understand core AWS services and how they interact.
2. Gain confidence in building web apps on AWS.
3. Learn essential cloud development concepts.
4. Practice clean code and AWS best practices.
